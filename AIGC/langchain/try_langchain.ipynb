      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: This is a free eBook of H. G. Wells' \"The Time Machine,\" available through Project Gutenberg. It can be copied, shared, or reused under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License, with no cost and minimal restrictions. Originally published in 1898, the eBook version was released in English on October 2, 2004 (EBook #35), and last updated on October 3, 2014. The story begins with the Time Traveller, a passionate and animated individual, introducing the concept of time travel to a group of friends during an intimate gathering. Set against the backdrop of a warm, luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, the scene establishes the foundation for the Time Traveller's extraordinary journey through time. During this discussion, the Time Traveller challenges universally accepted ideas, such as traditional geometry, by explaining that dimensions like length, breadth, and thickness are insufficient to fully describe reality without considering duration. He emphasizes that any real body must have extension in four directions: length, breadth, thickness, and time itself. By questioning whether an \"instantaneous\" cube—existing without duration—can truly have real existence, he pushes his audience to reconsider their assumptions about the nature of reality. Furthermore, he explains that consciousness moves intermittently along the dimension of time, from the beginning to the end of one's life, reinforcing the idea of time as a fundamental aspect of existence. He encourages free-thinking and suggests that thought should roam gracefully without the constraints of precision. As he passionately explains his ideas to his skeptical audience—like Filby, who questions the feasibility of such concepts—he captivates his listeners with his earnestness and imaginative insights, marking key points with a lean forefinger.\n",
